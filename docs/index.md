## Benefits of using pid4cat

- **Persistence**: Identifiers remain valid even if the location of the resource changes
- **Resolvability**: Identifiers can be resolved to access the identified resource or its metadata
- **Distributed management**: Partner organizations can manage their own namespaces
- **Rich metadata**: Support for comprehensive, structured identifier-related metadata
- **Community standards**: Alignment with catalysis research community standards and practices
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing PID systems and linked data principles.
