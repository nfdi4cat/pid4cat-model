# Open Data

We plan to make a PID meta data dump available as FAIR data in the future.

## PID Metadata Dump

As part of our commitment to FAIR data principles, pid4cat will provide regular dumps of PID metadata. These dumps will:

- Be available in multiple formats (JSON, RDF, CSV)
- Include all non-sensitive metadata fields
- Be licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Be assigned their own pid4cat identifiers

### Availability

The metadata dumps will be available through:

1. Direct download from the pid4cat website
2. API access for programmatic retrieval
3. Integration with metadata aggregators

### Usage

The metadata dumps can be used for:

- Research on PID usage patterns
- Integration with discovery services
- Network analysis of PID relationships
- Development of value-added services

## PID Graph Integration

pid4cat is designed to integrate with the broader PID Graph ecosystem. The PID Graph connects different types of persistent identifiers, creating a rich network of scholarly entities.

pid4cat contributes to this ecosystem by:

1. Including relationships to other PIDs in its metadata
2. Using standard relationship types
3. Exposing metadata in machine-readable formats
4. Supporting linked data principles

## Analytics and Reporting

The open data approach enables various analytics and reporting functions:

1. **Usage statistics**: Tracking resolution requests and metadata access
2. **Growth metrics**: Monitoring the growth of pid4cat identifiers over time
3. **Connectivity analysis**: Analyzing relationships between pid4cat identifiers and other PIDs
4. **Community impact**: Assessing the impact of pid4cat on the research community

These analytics will be made available through regular reports and an interactive dashboard.
