title: pid4cat-model
description: >-
  A LinkML model for persistent identifiers for resources in catalysis
  (pid4cat). pid4cat are handle based persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital
  or physical resources used in the catalysis research process. PID-related
  metadata besides the obligatory landing page URL are stored directly in the
  handle records.

  The model describes metadata for the PID itself and how to access the
  identified resource. It does not describe the resource itself with the
  exception of the resource category, which is a high-level description of
  what is identified by the pid4cat handle, e.g. a sample or a device.
