description: >-
  A LinkML model for PIDs for resources in catalysis (pid4cat). pid4cat is a
  handle system based persistent identifier (PID) for digital or physical
  resources used in the catalysis research process. The handle record is used
  to store additional metadata about the PID besides the obligatory landing page URL.

  The model describes metadata for the PID itself and how to access the
  identified resource. It does not describe the resource itself with the
  exception of the resource category, which is a high-level description of
  what is identified by the pid4cat handle, e.g. a sample or a device.
